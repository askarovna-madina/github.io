    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Before you start writing full-fledged code with inputs and outputs, you need to go through one fundamental topic, like data types. 
        This topic needs to be known regardless of the programming language.
        <br> It is very important to remember that the C++ programming language, unlike other languages, has a stricter syntax. 
        In it, in order to declare a variable, the type of this variable must first be written, then the name and value.
        <br> Data types are classified in different ways, but we will focus on the most important and commonly used ones.</p>
    <section>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The boolean data type has two values, true and false. Most often this data type is used to test some condition.</li>
                <li>The character data type is a set of characters. These characters can be letters, numbers, punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, etc.
                They are all ordered in a special table called <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii" target="_blank" class="ascii">ASCII</a> code.</li>
                <li>The Integer data type includes all integers, that is, numbers without floating point.</li>
                <li>Float and Double are part of the floating point data type. The only difference between them is their range. Float are numbers that can reach up to 7 characters, while Double is up to 15. 
                Accordingly, Double is also larger in size.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Type</td>
                <td>Code</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>float</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Double</td>
                <td>double</td>

        When writing code in C++, there is a mandatory part of the code that is always repeated.

        Writing algorithm:
        <ol>
            <dl>
                <li>Write header file</li>
                <dt>#include &ltiostream&gt </dt>
                <dd>- designed to provide means of input and output</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <li>Point to the namespace std</li>
                <dt>using namespace std;</dt>
                <dd>- all input and output capabilities are stored in this space</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <li>Ð¡onnect the main function</li>
                <dt>int main(){...code body...}</dt>
                <dd>- every C++ program contains one or more functions, one of which must be named main().</dd>
